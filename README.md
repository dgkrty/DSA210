**Description:**

This project aims to calculate correlation between exam dates and severity of bad dreams I have. I have these unsettling dreams often, and I wanted to see if it is related with stress of exams incoming.

**Dataset:**

Dataset I use is my own record  of if I had bad dream that day, either yes or no; and dates from calendar to check if there was exam near that time. 

**Plan:**

I will be using Python libraries like panda for this.
