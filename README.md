**Description:**

This project aims to calculate correlation between exam dates and severity of bad dreams I have. I have these unsettling dreams often, and I wanted to see if it is related with stress of exams incoming.

**Dataset:**

Dataset I use is my own record  of if I had bad dream that day, either yes or no; and dates from calendar to check if there was exam near that time. 

**Plan:**

I will be using Python libraries like panda for this.

**Results:**

I made plot graph of my data. The green represents nightmare and orange represents exam date. My found pvalue is P-value: 0.01433610706236198. While some nightmare dates are at same day or close to the exam dates and I found correlation value between them, I don't think these datas are enough to say there's correlation between them. I also don't have enough data to be sure.
